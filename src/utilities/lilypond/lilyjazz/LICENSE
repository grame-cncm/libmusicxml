In March 2013 Torsten Hämmerle sent a wonderful LilyPond add-on to the lilypond-user mailing
list: LilyJAZZ. Read his original announcement in this message
(http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/lilypond-user/2013-03/msg00647.html).  LilyJAZZ offers a
JAZZ Music and a JAZZ Text font along with tools to integrate them in LilyPond.

Disclaimer:

The licensing status of this material isn't completely clear. The original developer isn't
available and can't be contacted through email or phone anymore. Therefore we can only rely on
his original post where he states that

> the whole LilyJAZZ issue shall be open and free (just like Lilypond)...

We consider this as a release under the same licensing model as LilyPond (i.e.  GPL). "shall
be" is surely not meant as a temporal expression but as an expression of intent (it is probably
inexactly translated from the German "soll sein", not from "wird sein"). Torsten surely meant
that having created the fonts was the prerequisite for being able to release it under a free
license, and not that making the material available in that message was the prerequisite to
release it "open and free" at some undetermined point in future.
