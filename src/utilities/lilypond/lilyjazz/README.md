LilyJAZZ Font Family
====================

To make the most of these fonts, there are two text fonts that should be installed in the
normal font installation location (which is different for each OS):

- **lilyjazz-text**: A hand-written font that is common for jazz text objects. This is the
  default text font in the ``lilyjazz.ily`` stylesheet.

- **lilyjazz-chord**: Another hand-written font that is more calm with some convenience
  characters for typesetting sharps, flats, etc. This font is used in the ``jazzchords.ily``
  stylesheet.
